    <h1>Speech: To be, or not to be--that is the question</h1>
    <p>BY <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare"></a></p>
    <p>To be, or not to be, that is the question:<br>'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
        The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
        Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,<br>
        And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep;<br>
        No more; and by a sleep, to say we end<br>
        The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks<br>
        That Flesh is heir to? ' Tis a consummation<br> Devoutly to be wished. To die,<br> to sleep, To sleep, perchance
        to
        Dream; aye, there's the rub,<br> For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,<br> When we have shuffled off
        this mortal coil,<br> Must give us pause. There's the respect That makes Calamity of so long life:<br> For who
        would
        bear the Whips and Scorns of time,<br> The Oppressor's wrong, the proud man's Contumely,<br> The pangs of
        dispised
        Love, the Lawâ€™s delay,<br> The insolence of Office, and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br>
        When he himself might his Quietus make With a bare Bodkin?<br> Who would Fardels bear, [F: these Fardels] To
        grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br> But that the dread of something after death,<br> The undiscovered
        country,
        from whose bourn No traveller returns,<br> puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have,<br>
        Than
        fly to others that we know not of.<br> Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, And thus the native hue
        of<br>
        Resolution Is sicklied o'er, with the pale cast of Thought,<br> And enterprises of great pitch and moment,<br>
        [F:
        pith] With this regard their Currents turn awry, [F: away]<br> And lose the name of Action. Soft you now, The
        fair Ophelia?<br> Nymph, in thy Orisons Be all my sins rememberd. </p>
